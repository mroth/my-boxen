## Getting started with Boxen

- Make sure you are running Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
- Install the [Xcode Command Line Tools][xcode-cli] (or install the full Xcode
  from the Mac App Store).
- Install and run Boxen using option 1 or 2 below.

[xcode-cli]: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

### 1. If you have a have clean build of Mac OS X

If (and only if) you haven't installed Homebrew or Git or any other tools on
your Mac, then the easiest option will be to follow the instructions at
http://mroth-boxen.herokuapp.com/.

### 2. If you are attempting to Boxen-ise an already-setup Mac
First, make sure you uninstall rvm if you are using it, and better off uninstalling homebrew!

    sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
    sudo chown ${USER}:admin /opt/boxen
    git clone git@github.com:mroth/my-boxen.git /opt/boxen/repo
    cd /opt/boxen/repo

    PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin script/boxen --srcdir=/Users/${USER}/govuk
    # If your project directory is not /Users/$USER/govuk/ then use
    # PATH=... script/boxen --srcdir=/path/to/project/directory

    # add boxen to your shell config, at the end, eg.
    echo '[ -f /opt/boxen/env.sh ] && source /opt/boxen/env.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
    # or if you use ZSH
    echo '[ -f /opt/boxen/env.sh ] && source /opt/boxen/env.sh' >> ~/.zshrc

Open a new terminal, `boxen --env` to confirm.

- Create a personal module to define what you want on your Mac. See [the
  documentation in the `modules/people`](modules/people/README.md) directory for
  creating per-user modules that don't need to be applied globally to everyone.
  You will probably want to:
  - `include somepackage` - see other users for details
  - `include projects::someproject` - for the projects you will work on
  - if `modules/teams/manifests/yourteam.pp` exists, you should `include
    teams::yourteam` to get shared team config

## Removing install of Homebrew in /usr/local/bin

- Boxen installs its own version of Homebrew in `/opt/boxen/homebrew` which may
  conflict with a previous version installed in `/usr/local/bin`.
- You can list the brews installed in your previous version with:

        /usr/local/bin/brew list

- You can list the brews installed by Boxen with:

        /opt/boxen/homebrew/bin/brew list

- To generate a list of previous homebrew builds (to add to
  `modules/people/manifests/yourgithubuser.pp`) you can do:

        /usr/local/bin/brew list | (
            echo "package { ["
            while read line; do
                echo "           '$line',"
            done
            echo "          ]:"
            echo "          ensure => 'present',"
            echo "}"
        )

- One you have installed your previous brews with Boxen (run the `boxen` command
  after adding the resource generated above) you can [delete the previous
  homebrew](https://gist.github.com/mxcl/1173223)
